Project Description: Amazon Sales Data Analysis
This project aims to explore and analyze the Amazon Sales dataset to uncover valuable insights regarding customer behavior, product performance, and market trends. 
With a focus on data quality and accuracy, the analysis employs various statistical methods and visualizations to facilitate informed decision-making for businesses and researchers.

**Project Overview**

The Amazon Sales dataset comprises 1,465 rows and 16 columns, including essential attributes such as product IDs, names, categories, prices, ratings, and reviews. Initially, all columns were of the object data type, requiring conversion for numeric analysis. A crucial part of the data wrangling process involved identifying and addressing missing values to ensure the reliability of the insights derived.

**The project is structured around several key inquiries:**


Customer Ratings: Analyzing average ratings across product categories to identify areas for improvement and customer satisfaction.
Product Popularity: Assessing the top products based on review counts to gauge customer interest and engagement.

Discount Strategies: Investigating average discount percentages across categories, highlighting competitive pricing and inventory management.
Keyword Analysis: Identifying common keywords in product descriptions and reviews to enhance product visibility and marketing strategies.
Sentiment Analysis: Evaluating customer reviews to extract sentiment scores, informing product enhancements and addressing customer concerns.
Methodology
The analysis employs various Python libraries, including Pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical calculations, Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization, and SciPy for advanced statistical operations. The methodology consists of:


Cleaning and preprocessing the dataset, including handling missing values and converting data types.
Conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize trends and relationships among variables.
Performing sentiment analysis on customer reviews to understand customer sentiments and feedback.
Conclusion
The insights gained from this analysis will empower businesses to make data-driven decisions regarding product offerings, marketing strategies, and customer engagement efforts. By understanding customer preferences and market dynamics, businesses can enhance their operational efficiency and competitiveness in the marketplace.
